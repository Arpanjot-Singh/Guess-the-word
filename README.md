Guess the Word
This project is a web application developed using ReactJS that allows users to guess a random five-letter word within six attempts. The game is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, allowing users to input their guesses and see the results. The application implements an algorithm that evaluates user guesses to determine the number of correct letters and positions.
